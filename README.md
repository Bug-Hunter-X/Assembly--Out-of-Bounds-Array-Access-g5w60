This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: accessing memory outside the allocated bounds of an array. The `bug.asm` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version with improved bounds checking.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in low-level programming.  Understanding memory addresses and array indexing is crucial to avoid such issues.
